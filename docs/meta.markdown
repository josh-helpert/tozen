This level adds features which supports metaprogramming.
This is the highest level which is the basis of all abstractions.

Metaprogramming is...TODO...
* elems
* diff types

It is built on top of [General Purpose Level](./full) and is the only dependency.
It can emit any of the previous levels IR.
The code emitted will match the guarantees of that level.


## Basics
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Much list LISPs, the basis of metaprogramming uses the language itself.
For Tozen, these are: data, variables, and functions.
For convenience, there is also some added sugar to make the code more terse.

A developer should be familiar with metaprogramming as it functions very similarly as the general purpose language.
